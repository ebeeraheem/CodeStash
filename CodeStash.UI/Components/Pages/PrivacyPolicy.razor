        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how CodeStash (“we”, “our”, or “the Platform”) collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our website, <a href="@Configuration["CodeStash:UIUrl"]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">codestash.ng</a> (the “Site”). By using CodeStash, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

            <li>
                <strong>Authentication:</strong> To verify your identity and provide you with access to your account.

            <strong>No Third-Party Sharing (For Now):</strong> We do not currently share your personal information with third parties. This may be subject to change in the future; if it does, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. While we take reasonable steps to secure your data, no online service is completely secure.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Legal Compliance and Changes</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the bottom of this document and post the revised policy on the Site. Your continued use of CodeStash after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
        </p>
